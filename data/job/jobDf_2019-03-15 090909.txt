In particular, we encourage our employees to  participate, to give their time and talents, not just money, to charitable  events and organizations the Firm supports through our employee run charitable  committee, the Alger Candlelight Giving Program. Pensions & Investments has noted, “Fred  Alger Management Inc. [is] one of the most charity-oriented workforces in the  investment industry.” (Sept. 5, 2011).  We are as proud of that recognition as we are of our investment success.Job  Description:Alger is seeking bright and enthusiastic  Associate Analysts (AAs) to join our investment team. We favor candidates who are passionate about  investing, embrace challenges, welcome increasing responsibilities, and thrive  in a dynamic environment.Alger’s Investment Team is the engine that  drives the Firm’s strong long-term investment returns of our portfolio  strategies and success for our clients.  Our investment strategies range from U.S. small cap to large cap stocks  and International and Emerging Markets growth stocks, in both traditional  long-only and long/short hedged equity portfolios. We have over 40 experienced professionals,  led by our portfolio managers and senior sector analysts, who work together to  identify and research domestic and global growth trends across all economic  sectors to uncover compelling investment opportunities. We target “outside the box” ideas and our  firm’s philosophy encourages creative and independent thinking. Each investment idea goes through a rigorous  series of analyses by sector specialists rather than generalists. Many of our analysts have direct experience  in the industries they invest in and/or advanced degrees in their fields. Compared to other buy-side firms, our teams  are small – and this “boutique” culture allows analysts of all levels to contribute. Working in smaller groups, analysts have more  responsibilities, rather than being just a “number-cruncher” at a larger  firm. With that in mind, we focus on  investing in developing talent. Many of  our senior analysts have started their careers at Alger at the AA level.AAs, along with their  team, work with portfolio managers and the Chief Investment Officer on  generating insightful investment ideas. This direct exposure to top level  management is rare in the investment community and current AAs thrive on the  ability to work with highly experienced investors. Upon hire, AAs will be  assigned to permanent sectors with an opportunity to rise among the ranks of  the investment team.Duties &  Responsibilities: Work closely with  senior analysts to coordinate evaluation of companiesInteract with sell-side  analysts, industry contacts, investor relations personnel and senior management  of companies to develop an investment thesis on a stock or macroeconomic themeCreate and update  financial models and maintaining databases tracking industry research and  statistics.
