"Job Recommendation"

This project is about to scrape "job" postings from glassdoor. These include job title, company, review, salary, benefit, qualification, post date, etc. 

Essentially, the project focuses on "data analyst", "data scientist", and associated skills (such as R, Python, SQL). 

The project applies text mining on job description. Furthermore, a classification algorithm would be used to sort out desirable "jobs".

Eventually, we can create a daily email alert using R and Windows Task Scheduler - sending and visualizing these "jobs" to an email recipient(s).
