"Job Recommendation"

This project is about to scrape "job" postings from glassdoor. These include job title, company, review, salary, benefit, qualification, post date, etc. 

The project focuses on "data analyst", "data scientist", "business intelligence" and associated skills (such as R, Python, SQL, Tableau, etc.). 

A classification algorithm (such as logistic regression, SVM) would be used to sort out desirable "jobs".

Eventually, we can create a daily job recommendation email using R and Windows Task Scheduler. Plus, creating a simple dashboard using shinyApp to visualize these jobs.
